# Style guide

The following style guide is a checklist to keep the writing consistent across files:

- [ ] Use ATX headings (`#`, `##`, …)
  - [ ] Keep headings short
  - [ ] Only one `h1` per file
  - [ ] Add empty lines surrounded `---` before `h2` to separate content (optional) and before `Next:` sections (mandatory)
- [ ] Prefer short paragraphs for brief explanations
- [ ] Keep use of lists sensible
  - [ ] Ordered lists by number when order is truly important
  - [ ] Unordered lists for brief steps
  - [ ] Task lists for guiding and selected/unselected external options
  - [ ] No period on single sentenced list items
- [ ] Fenced code blocks with language tag
- [ ] Link to files of docs, examples and other related files if helpful
  - [ ] Prefer relative links inside the repository
- [ ] Use typographic adjustments to ensure readbility
  - [ ] Use non-breaking spaces
    - [ ] After 1–2 letter sentence starters (e.g. `If`, `A`)
    - [ ] After short articles (e.g. `a`, `an`, `the`)
    - [ ] Before 8 or less character long final words
  - [ ] Prefer period over semicolon separation
- [ ] Full possibilities of [writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github) where helpful
- [ ] Use [alerts](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) when they are crucial for user success
- [ ] HTML style comments to guide through markdown contributions if needed
